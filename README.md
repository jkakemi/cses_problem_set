# ðŸŸ¢ CSES Problem Set

This repository contains solutions to problems from the [CSES Problem Set](https://cses.fi/problemset/), a highly regarded collection for practicing algorithms and data structures.

## ðŸš€ Goals
- Build a solid foundation in competitive programming.
- Practice and master problem types like:
  - Sorting and searching
  - Dynamic programming
  - Graph algorithms
  - Mathematics and number theory

## ðŸ“Œ About the Problems
Each solution is organized by problem name and category. All solutions are written in C++ and follow the input/output format defined by CSES.

## ðŸ§  Why CSES?
The CSES Problem Set provides a structured path to grow as a competitive programmer. It covers a wide range of classic and advanced topics, making it an ideal resource for consistent practice.
